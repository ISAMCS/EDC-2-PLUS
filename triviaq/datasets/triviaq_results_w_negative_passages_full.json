Pericardiocentesis In medicine, pericardiocentesis (PCC) is a procedure where fluid is aspirated from the pericardium (the sac enveloping the heart). The patient undergoing pericardiocentesis is positioned supine with the head of the bed raised to a 30- to 60-degree angle. This places the heart in proximity to the chest wall for easier insertion of the needle into the pericardial sac. Anatomically, the procedure is carried out under the xiphoid",
